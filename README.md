# IG AutoScroll 📱✨

Yo, welcome to the repo. This is a chill Chrome extension that automatically scrolls your Instagram Reels so you don't have to lift a finger. Optimal for rot-maxxing or when you're eating and can't touch your mouse. 🍕

## What it does
- **Auto-Scrolls**: Moves to the next reel when the current one ends.
- **Smart Detection**: Knows when a reel loops (time jumps) and skips it anyway.
- **Vibe Check**: Comes with a cool gradient UI popup to toggle it on/off.

## How to Install (Local)
1. Clone this repo or download the files.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Flip that "Developer mode" switch in the top right.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and pick this folder.
5. Profit.

## Tech Stuff
- Manifest V3 (we modern).
- Uses a smart "Scroll Parent" detection algo because IG's DOM is messy af.
- Written in vanilla JS, no heavy frameworks.
